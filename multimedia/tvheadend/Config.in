config TVHEADEND_SATIP_CLIENT
	bool "SAT>IP client"
	default y
	help
	  Include SAT>IP client. This allows tvheadend to receive streams from a SAT>IP server.
	  SAT>IP is a client-server communication protocol in which SAT>IP servers,
	  connected to one or more DVB broadcast sources, send the program requested
	  by an SAT>IP client over an IP based network.
	  The main difference of SAT>IP to other IP-based TV distribution systems
	  such as IP-TV and DLNA is that the SAT>IP client does not select a program
	  from a server specific list, but has to specify the DVB reception parameters
	  such as the signal source, frequency, polarisation, modulation, PIDs and others.
